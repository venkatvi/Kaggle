This is a code base maintained towards Kaggle 101 Competition:
https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic-gettingStarted

Strategies followed are explained below:
Submission 1: 
Parse Ticket filed to 2 fields - Ticket Prefix, and Ticket Number
Parse Cabin - seperate Cabin class from number. If multiple cabin numbers present, add new rows for each of them 
use Mean Age, Fare as fillers
use 0 for missing Embarked
use '' for missing cabin class
use -1 for missing cabin number
use 1 for female and 0 for male
map 1 - C, 2- Q , 3 - S for Embarkment
Drop Name field
Random Forest to fit and predict
Prediction Accuracy 0.6406

Submission 2: 
Use graphsearchcv to cross validate data and fit a forest
<Intermediate Submissions - Use median instead of mode> 
Prediction Accuracy 0.66


Submission 3:
Parse Name field to extract "Title" -> map it to 0 - other, 1 - master, 2 - Miss, 3- Mr, 4 - Mrs. 
Drop ticket, cabin and Name fields
Retain gender, age, title, fare, parch, sibsp, pclass and embarked 
Use NaiveBayes in training and test data to predict Age 
Use random forest to predict survived 
Prediction Accuracy 0.56

Submission 4:
Drop ticket, cabin and name fields
Retain title
Use mean age and fare as fillers
Use random forest to predict 
Prediction Accuracy 0.744

Submission 5:
Use median in Submission 4 
Prediction Accuracy 0.741

Submission 6: 
Drop ticket, cabin, age, name, sibsp, parch
Use title (derived from name)
How about sex, title, pclass to predict survival ?
Prediction Accuracy: 0.78468

Submission 7:
Drop pclass . Use only sex and title 
No discrimination on the status
